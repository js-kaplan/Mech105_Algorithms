# Lu Factorization Algorithm
This algorithm takes the input A matrix and uses Gauss elimination and Lu decompisition to find the upper lower and pivot matrices.
## Inputs
* A - coefficient matrix
 ## Outputs
* L - lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
* U - upper triangular matrix
* P - the pivot matrix
