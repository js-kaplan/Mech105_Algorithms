# Linear Regression Algoritm
For this algoritm, the code takes the input data and uses Linear regression to calculate the slope and intercept of the data.
It also calculates the R squared value, which shows how accurate the line of best fit is
## Inputs
* x-values of the data set
* y-values of the data set
## Outputs
* Filtered x-values (i.e. the input x-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
* Filtered y-valeus (i.e. the input y-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
* Slope from the linear regression (m in y=mx+b form)
* Intercept from the linear regression (b in y=mx+b form)
* Rsquared value
