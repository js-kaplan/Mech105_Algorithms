# Simpsons Rule Integration Algorithm
This Algoritm takes the inputed x and y values and sues Simpsons 1/3 rule to calculate the integral of the data.
If the data has an even number of segments then the algorithm uses the trapazoidal rule for the last interval
## Inputs
* x -the vector of equally spaced independent variable
* y -the vector of function values with respect to x
## Outputs
* I -the numerical integral calculated
